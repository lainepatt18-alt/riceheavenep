            <h1>HISTORY OF THE BUSINESS</h1>
            <p>Rice Heaven began with a simple act of friendship. Elaine Patt and Joana Basto, lifelong friends, shared a passion for natural beauty and self-care. Joana had long struggled with acne and sensitive skin. She tried many products, but nothing seemed to truly work.
One day, Elaine remembered an old tradition passed down by her grandmother — using rice water and rice-based pastes to heal and brighten the skin. Determined to help her friend, Elaine created a homemade rice face mask using natural ingredients. Joana tried it consistently, and within a few weeks, her skin became clearer, brighter, and more balanced.
Inspired by this transformation, the two friends began experimenting together. They expanded their creations to include rice-based face soaps and hair masks, discovering even more benefits such as stronger hair, smoother skin, and deep hydration. Their family and friends noticed the results and began requesting products of their own.
As demand grew, Elaine and Joana saw the potential to turn their shared passion into something greater. With trust, creativity, and a commitment to natural skincare, they officially established Rice Heaven as a partnership business..</p>
